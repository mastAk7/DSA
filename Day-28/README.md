### Starting off, due to health conditions, I wasnt left with enough strength to handle this github stuff and just silently handled DSA (to the extent i could bit by bit)

    1. Started DSA from base again but this time from Interview and CP point of view as well.
    
    2. Binary search while solving hard difficultly questions as well. example: applying binary search wherever i could establish a monotonic function and hence iterate within a range.

    3. Abstract Data Types: building and implementing all data types from base (array, classes, struct, template, etc)

    4. Prime numbers, prime factorization and learning about different complexities and algorithms. GCD was almost a subpart of it.

    5. Binary exponentiation for finding powers in logn complexity while the default version takes O(n)

    6. Combinators and PNC were interesting. Modular arithmetics also implemented. 

    7. Prefix sum or i would say static range queries are truely important for CP point of view and hence practically helped me out too much.

    8. And finally the master of all : Dynamic Programming. Started but not mastered. Currently building a thinking and base for bottom-up or iterative algorithm. Would be diving deep in the upcoming days.
