## Note 1
- My summer break began from mid may and hence I decided to polish my skills. The first month everything went on track: maintained a month long streak on leetcode, maintained a good rating on codeForces and LeetCode.
- For the next 20 days, I went severely ill and hence it backlashed too hard to me.
- Towards the end of June, I got hired by good company and was giving the task of developing their website (Vardhman Airport Solutions) and hence the remaining June and entire July went to them.
- Now that everything is over, I am back onto giving all my energy to my Coding Journey.

---

## Note 2
- Was just inactive on github and that is it. DSA is going good enough

---


## Future Goals
- I would be regular now on while I am aiming to get a rating of 1600 on both CodeForces and LeetCode.
- I would be covering upto recursion, Linked Lists, Trees this week.
- For the next, I would be covering and hence solving questions on DP.
- The last week of this month would be going to graphs, mapping, hashtables and remainging algorithms and data structures.
- Next month onwards, I will be full fledged resuming my CP journey.
